# RoomPartner

## What's this about?
Many college students are faced with the struggle of finding the right roommate to dorm with. There is enough academic stress to worry about and residential life should be the least of their concern - and yet its not. Finding the right person to live with should not be a gamble and so RoomPartner is a social app that is specifically designed to help students share their interests and habitual information to discover the right fit. In short words: a Tinder app for finding roommates.
